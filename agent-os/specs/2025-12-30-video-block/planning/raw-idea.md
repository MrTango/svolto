# Raw Idea: Video Block

## Feature Description

Implement a video block for a SvelteKit-based frontend (Svolto) that renders Plone CMS content. This is similar to other blocks already implemented (image, slate, teaser, grid, etc.).

## Context

This feature will add video playback capabilities to the Svolto block system, following the same architecture pattern as existing blocks (image, slate, teaser, grid, slateTable, etc.).
