# Raw Idea: Listing Block

## Feature Description

Implement a listing block for the Svolto project (SvelteKit-based Plone frontend).

The user wants to implement a listing block that follows the same architecture pattern as existing blocks (image, slate, teaser) in the project. This block should integrate with the Plone backend's listing functionality and render lists of content items.

## Context

- Project: Svolto - SvelteKit-based frontend for rendering Plone CMS content
- Architecture: Follows Volto's block configuration pattern
- Block registry: src/lib/blocks/index.ts
- Block rendering: RenderBlocks.svelte
- Backend: Plone with plone.restapi enabled
