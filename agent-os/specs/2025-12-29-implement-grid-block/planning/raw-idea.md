# Raw Idea

implement the grid block

## Context

This feature request is for the Svolto project - a SvelteKit-based frontend for rendering Plone CMS content. The project renders Volto Blocks content from a Plone backend with plone.restapi enabled.

The grid block is a standard Volto block type that needs to be implemented in Svolto to achieve feature parity with Volto.
